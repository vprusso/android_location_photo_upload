user_location_and_upload_picture
==========================
*Android application that obtains users coordinates in terms of latitude 
and longitude and also allows the user to upload a picture of the sky. 
This information is then sent to a server. Currently, the server is 
http://vprusso-spaceapps-beta.site88.net/ hosted at 000webhost. Will want
to change the server to a more professional one for the real deal though.
